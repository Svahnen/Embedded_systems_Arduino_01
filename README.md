# Embedded_systems_Arduino_01
A laboration template for Arduino Uno R3

A RGB LED connected to PB1(b) PB2(g) and PB3(r) can be controlled by sending the following commands over UART (8N1, 38400 baud):

"ON\r\n" Set all colors to on <br>
"OFF\r\n" Set all colors to off <br>
"BLUE\r\n" Toggle blue <br>
"GREEN\r\n" Toggle green <br>
"RED\r\n" Toggle red <br>

This project is built in steps and those steps are saved as functioning bits in their own branch
