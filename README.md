# Embedded_systems_Arduino_01
A laboration template for Arduino Uno R3

A RGB LED connected to PB1(b) PB2(g) and PB3(r) can be controlled by sending the following commands over UART:

"ON\r\n" Set all colors to on
"OFF\r\n" Set all colors to off
"BLUE\r\n" Toggle blue
"GREEN\r\n" Toggle green
"RED\r\n" Toggle red

This project is built in steps and those steps are saved as functioning bits in their own branch
